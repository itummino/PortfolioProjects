## A Global Look into Cases, Deaths, & Vaccinations Data
![](/images/covid19.jpg)  

- Imported global Covid-19 data from ourworldindata.org from pandemic start (Feb 2020) to current (May 2021) into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Extracted and organized case/deaths data and vaccinations data into two separate CSVs to perform table JOINs
- Used SQL data cleaning and complex queries to determine aggregate figures of total cases VS the population, analyzing trends between both the United States and around the globe
## Points of interest: 
    - Countries with the highest infection rate and highest death count compared to the population
    - Trends of cases/deaths over time, created a death percentage to visualize data more accurately
    - Calculated the percentage of the U.S. population that contracted Covid-19 vs global figures
    - Total population versus recorded vaccinations over time, calculated a global vaccination rate and used TEMP table and CTE 
    - All new vaccines administered in the US over time
    - Total vaccinations administered globally according to income bracket (low, lower middle, upper middle, high income)
- Created views to store/condense the data in SSMS and then export into Tableau for data visualizations
- Built 3 different Tableau vizzes for final analysis:
    - [Global Covid-19 Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isabel.tummino/viz/GlobalCovid19Data/GlobalCovidData)
    - [US Covid-19 Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isabel.tummino/viz/U_S_Covid19Data/U_S_CovidData)
    - [Global Vaccinations Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isabel.tummino/viz/VaccinationsData/GlobalVaccinationData)

- This will be a series of data cleaning, which is useful for showcasing my SQL skills and ability to standardize data for efficiency and ease of use
